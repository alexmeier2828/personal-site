        <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <p>When not in school or work I spend the majority of my time making music.
          I am an amature electronic music producer focusing on the synthwave, lofi,
          and vaporwave subgenres.  As a part of this, I am also focused on expanding
          my audience through social media and other means.  My ultimate goal someday
          is to have a full LP of my music pressed in vinyl.
